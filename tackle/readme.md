# This is tackle.
It is an overopionioated scrum tool.
It try to force you to use the scrum methodology 110%.

If you dare to use it you have to:

1. Create a product backlog
2. Create a sprint backlog - mark for "now"
3. Click on start. There is no stop button.

The sprint will start. You have to finish the sprint.

# So?
When the sprint is finished you have to create a sprint review.
Between review and retrospektive you have to mark new tasks for the next sprint.
The tasks not finsished in the sprint will be moved to the next sprint. 
If you mark them as done and they are not done, you are a liar and tackle hates your guts.
If you want to remove a task from a sprint you have to destroy it and give a reason. It should be a good reason or again, tackle will hate your guts.

You also have to create a sprint retrospective.

# Again, so?
After a while there will be data.
We will now how many tasks you do in a sprint on average.
We know how many tasks are in your backlog. We now know when you will finish your project.

If you are very lucky, you will finish your project before the deadline.
In most cases you will not. That means you have to --work harder--remove features.
How to decide what to remove? Your best bet is feedback. Ask the customer and or make a super wild guess how much money you will not get until a feature is not completed (cost of delay).
You can add that info to the backlog. We order the backlog by cost of delay.

Now you can do highest cost of delay. When the deadline arrives or if there is no deadline makes no difference.
You will make the most revenue if you tackle the sparkling features first. The ones that help you to make money.

# Ok, but ..
Some tickets seem to have no cost of delay attached. Like refactor or clean up or decouple. That's not true. They have a cost of delay.
They cost time. Time is money. It costs the time of the developer. The developer could do something else. Something that makes money.

Since they could work on the feature that makes money, the time savings in a week is the factor compared to the cost of delay of the most important feature.

Here comes a very fuzzy calculation: 
Cost of Delay of a feature: 1000 (coins a week)
Cost of Delay of a refactor: 100 (time a week)
Time available before refactor: 20 hours
Time available after refactor: 22 hours
Productivity increase after refactor: 10%
Cost of Delay of most important feature before refactor: 1000 
Cost of Delay of most important feature after refactor: 1000 (but you get it done 10% faster)
Since we do not know the exact time that most important factor will be done, we can't exaclty say how much money we save on refactor.
If the featur is high COD but low time, we save a lot of money. If the feature takes very long we save even more money, because the effect of after done will activate only after done. 
the effect of a refactor will also activate after done. 

But if you do not refactor, the effect of the refactor will never activate. And you will never be faster.
And you will take much longer to get the effect of done features. And you will get slower and slower.

So there has to be a balance. And it works pretty much like debt, that's why it is called tech debt.

If you do not even pay the interest, you will get slower and slower.
If you only pay the interest, you will never get faster.
You really have to pay the interest at least. If you can't do that, there is a high possibilty of slowdown to complete stop. At least it will feel like an action movie. 
Everything moves fast and you are in slow motion though. Which means you are dead.

# But tackle, what can I do?
Did we mention that tackle is opionated? That's kinda wrong. It is EXTREMELY opionated.
And that's why we force refactoring-like tasks into each sprint. In the beginning we have no data. We have to guess.

We give you 90% of feature time at the beginning. 10% is refactoring, planning, whatever.

Then there will be data. If we see you are getting slower, we will increase the refactoring time. You can ignore that. And again, tackle will hate your guts.

# Ok, but ..
And tackle is not only EXTREMELY opionated. It is as opionated as possible. The more you slow down the more it will nag you.
It will start cluttering the UI with warnings. "Did you implement TDD yet?", "Do you even CI?", "I really hope your CD is not a CD player", "HOW are your refactorings going, darling?"

At some point YOU WILL LOOSE DARK MODE!

If you become even slower we take it as a sign you ignore us. The contrast will be decreased bit by bit. Colors will get ugly. Fonts turn to comic sans. 

At that point I don't yet know how to punish you more. But remember, OPIONATED! We will find a way.

Because, we are tackle and we are overoptionionated.
